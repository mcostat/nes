## About NES

NES is an open-source tool that aims to assist neuroscience research laboratories in routine procedures for data collection. NES supports the reproducibility of experiments, enables comparison of data across studies, and keeps data provenance. In addition, it promotes standardized formats for experiments and analyses reporting.

### Features

- Participant registration: participants’ personal data, social demographic data, social history, and medical evaluations.
- Experiment management: tasks, stimuli, instructions, EEG, EMG, TMS, questionnaire administration, goalkeeper game and generic data collection (stabilometry, kinematic measures, response time, etc).
- Questionnaire management: integration with LimeSurvey (open source software).
- Data exportation: NES allows to export all data and metadata of the experiments which it stores. Textual and numeric data are organized in standard plain-text format files (CSV or TSV). EEG raw data can be exported in the Neuroscience Without Border (NWB) format.

### Documentation

## RIDC NeuroMat

The Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics (RIDC NeuroMat, or simply NeuroMat) is a Brazilian research center established in 2013 at the University of São Paulo that is dedicated to integrating mathematical modeling and theoretical neuroscience. Among the core missions of NeuroMat is the creation of a new mathematical system to understanding neural data and the development of neuroscientific open-source computational tools, keeping an active role under the context of open knowledge, open science, and scientific dissemination. The research center is headed by Prof. Antonio Galves, from USP's Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, and is funded by the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).
